Tools for the game Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes

##Requirements
 - Python 2.7.10
 - pip
 - colorama

##Execution
Execute the applicable script from the command line. These tools use colorama to enhance the output to the terminal. Executing a script will prompt the user to enter some details about the given bomb, and return formatted text to the terminal regarding how to proceed.

Currently, a script has been implemented for Complex Wires. A script for memory is in progress. A future version will remove the requirement for colorama in the event the user does not have it installed.
